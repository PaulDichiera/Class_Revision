- Allocating and De-allocating memory

"Task 1"
the creation of an object called example using a class. implemented a constructor a setter and getter then completed it by adding a destructor to the class to deallocate the memory when the program ends.

"Task 2"
for task two I had to use typedef to create trypes for a number of type and create and allocate the appropriate data, i had some issue when printing the information from my doubles array. in past tasks I was able to pass the whole array into the 'cout' function however it did not print for the double array, i had to iterate through the array.

For the pointers to floats i had issues allocating the data I needed to allocate data on the heap using 'new' ie 'float[i] = new float(2.2)' essentially I needed to allocate memory on the heap and define the type attaching it to the pointer address in the array. also because it was a pointer to a float I needed to ensure the data was dproperly defined as a float
to print the float pointer array i had to dereference and iterate through each element.
